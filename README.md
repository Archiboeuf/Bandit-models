# Bandit models
Project realized as part of a course of *Online Learning and Aggregation in Statistical Learning* at ENSAE. Done in collaboration with a fellow student. Report and code in French.

We studied an article of Emilie Kaufmann and Aurélien Garivier on bandit models in order to minimize the regret (i.e. maximize earnings) or identify the best action rapidly. We implemented the methods presented in the article.

# Bandit-models
Project realized as part of a course of *Online Learning and Aggregation in Statistical Learning* at ENSAE. Done in collaboration with a fellow student. Report and code in French.

We studied an article of Emilie Kaufmann and Aur√©lien Garivier on bandit models in order to minimize the regret (i.e. maximize earnings) or identify the best action rapidly. We implemented the methods presented in the article.
